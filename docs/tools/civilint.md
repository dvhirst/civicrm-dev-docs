Civilint is a thin wrapper which calls jshint and PHP_CodeSniffer (with the coder ruleset).

Code-style tests ensure a consistent layout across all of the codebase, and they also identify some unsafe or confusing coding patterns. While working on a patch, you should run civilint to determine if the pending changes comply with style guides. 

Note that civilint may be invoked a few different ways:

```bash
# (no arguments) â€“ Check style of any uncommitted changes.
civilint

# Check style of a specific file (or list of files).
civilint some/file.php

# Check your last commit
git diff --name-only HEAD~1 | civilint -

# Check for changes in your branch (compared to master)
git diff --name-only master | civilint -
```
