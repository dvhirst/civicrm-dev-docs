!!! abstract
    This area of CiviCRM code and documentation is a work-in-progress. Not all features
    will be documented and the core code underlying this area may change from version
    to version.

An 'order' is our developer term for a pseudo-entity that maps to the CiviCRM contribution object but also encompasses related entities like line items, memberships, event registrations and underlying financial entities. There is no single 'order' table but the top level order information is stored in the civicrm_contribution table.

The Order API is intended to be used as the primary API for adding, updating, and deleting orders. When using the Order API you should:

1. Rely on the Order API to create related objects like line items, memberships and event registrations. (Don't pre-create them)
2. Always create orders in a pending state (unfortunately you need to pass contribution_status_id = Pending in for historical reasons).
3. Expect the status of contribution and any related memberships or event registrations to be Pending.
4. Call Payment.create to record any payments that have been made against the order.
5. Rely on adding  payments to transition any relate entities to completed.

You should NOT

1. Pre-create line items memberships  or event registrations
1. Update the status of  an order to Completed using any  method OTHER than adding payments to it (Payment.create api)

## Sample `Order.create` for Simple Contribution

Here is how to record a simple donation.

### Step 1

Call `Order.create` with a structure like the below. Note that we always create orders with status Pending (but see Step 2 below).

```json
{
  "contact_id": 202,
  "total_amount": 1.23,
  "financial_type_id": "Donation",
  "receive_date": "2019-10-08",
  "contribution_status_id": "Pending",
  "line_items" : [
    {
      "params": { },
      "line_item": [
        {
          "qty": 1,
          "unit_price": 1.23,
          "line_total": 1.23,
          "price_field_id": 1,
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Things to note:

1. The outer array keys mostly refer to the Contribution record. We set the `contribution_status_id` to `Pending` when we create an order.

2. The `line_items` value is an array of objects each having `params` which describes an entity that needs to be created, and a `line_item` key, described next.

3. The `line_item` structure is also an array of line items that all belong to the entity described in the `params` structure. In this example the `params` structure is empty, and we have a single item under `line_item` which therefore is not related to anything other than the contribution.

4. The `line_item` structures use `price_field_id`. This relates to a particular field in a price set. For our simple contribution we can use `1` for which is a special default price field that is always available.

5. The `line_total` *must* equal the `unit_price` Ã— `qty`

!!! info
    If you provide a value to `total_amount` as we have above, it *must* equal the sum of all the `line_total` values. Before 5.20 there was [a bug](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/financial/issues/73) that required the top-level `total_amount` was provided, but from 5.20 onward you can omit this and it will be calculated automatically from the sum of the `line_items`.


Currently the data returned from `Order.create` shows only the fields from the created Contribution. However an `Order.get` API call for the ID will also include an array of `line_items` (see below for example).

### Step 2

Now we have our order set up we can complete the order by adding a payment for the total value: so we call the `Payment.create` API with at least the following parameters:

```json
{
  "contribution_id": 12345,
  "total_amount": 1.23
}
```

The Payment API works with the Order API to update the records, and an `Order.getsingle` request for the contribution will give something like the following:

```json
{
   "contact_id": "202",
    "contact_type": "Individual",
    "contact_sub_type": "",
    "sort_name": "admin@example.com",
    "display_name": "admin@example.com",
    "contribution_id": "95",
    "currency": "USD",
    "contribution_recur_id": "",
    "contribution_status_id": "1",
    "contribution_campaign_id": "",
    "payment_instrument_id": "4",
    "receive_date": "2019-10-08 12:42:35",
    "non_deductible_amount": "0.00",
    "total_amount": "1.23",
    "fee_amount": "0.00",
    "net_amount": "1.23",
    "trxn_id": "",
    "invoice_id": "",
    "invoice_number": "",
    "contribution_cancel_date": "",
    "cancel_reason": "",
    "receipt_date": "2019-10-08 12:42:36",
    "thankyou_date": "",
    "contribution_source": "",
    "amount_level": "",
    "is_test": "0",
    "is_pay_later": "0",
    "contribution_check_number": "",
    "financial_account_id": "1",
    "accounting_code": "4200",
    "campaign_id": "",
    "contribution_campaign_title": "",
    "financial_type_id": "1",
    "contribution_note": "",
    "contribution_batch": "",
    "civicrm_value_donor_information_3_id": "",
    "custom_6": "",
    "custom_5": "",
    "contribution_recur_status": "Completed",
    "payment_instrument": "Check",
    "contribution_status": "Completed",
    "financial_type": "Donation",
    "check_number": "",
    "instrument_id": "4",
    "cancel_date": "",
    "id": "95",
    "contribution_type_id": "1",
    "line_items": [
      {
        "id": "97",
        "entity_table": "civicrm_contribution",
        "entity_id": "95",
        "contribution_id": "95",
        "price_field_id": "1",
        "qty": "1.00",
        "unit_price": "1.23",
        "line_total": "1.23",
        "price_field_value_id": "1",
        "financial_type_id": "1",
        "non_deductible_amount": "0.00",
        "contribution_type_id": "1"
      }
    ]
}
```

Notes:

1. The `contribution_status_id` is now set to 1 (Completed).

2. The line item has inherited the `financial_type_id` from the contribution.

Behind the scenes these API calls have created lots of financial records as listed below. These records will not be removed no matter what happens to the contribution; if the contribution is cancelled/refunded, *more* financial records are added to create bookkeeping adjustment transactions that achieve the desired accounting result, including the preservation of an auditable log.

- A financial item is created against each line item.
- A row in the `civicrm_financial_trxn` table that describes the financial transaction; the transfer of funds between two accounts from the company's chart of accounts (e.g. in Xero/QuickBooks etc.)
- A row in `civicrm_entity_financial_trxn` links the financial item to a Financial Transaction.
- Another row in `civicrm_entity_financial_trxn` links that financial transaction back to the Contribution.


## Sample Order.create for Single Membership

Here is how to create an order for a single membership of type "General".
Again, we follow the 2 steps: Create the order, then complete the order with
the Payment API.

Here's the parameters for the `Order.create` call, which will create a Pending
Contribution, with a Pending Membership.

```json
{
  "contact_id": 202,
  "total_amount": 100.00,
  "financial_type_id": "Member Dues",
  "receive_date": "2019-10-08",
  "contribution_status_id": "Pending",
  "line_items" : [
    {
      "params": {
        "membership_type_id": "General",
        "contact_id": 202,
        "skipStatusCal": 1,
        "status_id": "Pending"
      },
      "line_item": [
        {
          "entity_table":"civicrm_membership",

          "price_field_id":"4",
          "price_field_value_id":"7",
          "qty":"1",
          "unit_price":"100.00",
          "line_total":"100.00"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

After this, when we call `Payment.create` to complete the transaction the membership becomes live and its status will be recalculated (e.g. to 'New').

The `Order.get` request returns all the information about the contribution, the line items and the related membership:

```json
{
    "contact_id": "202",
    "contact_type": "Individual",
    "contact_sub_type": "",
    "sort_name": "Wilma",
    "display_name": "Wilma",
    "contribution_id": "101",
    "currency": "USD",
    "contribution_recur_id": "",
    "contribution_status_id": "1",
    "contribution_campaign_id": "",
    "payment_instrument_id": "4",
    "receive_date": "2019-10-09 17:13:10",
    "non_deductible_amount": "0.00",
    "total_amount": "100.00",
    "fee_amount": "0.00",
    "net_amount": "100.00",
    "trxn_id": "",
    "invoice_id": "",
    "invoice_number": "",
    "contribution_cancel_date": "",
    "cancel_reason": "",
    "receipt_date": "2019-10-09 17:13:10",
    "thankyou_date": "",
    "contribution_source": "",
    "amount_level": "",
    "is_test": "0",
    "is_pay_later": "0",
    "contribution_check_number": "",
    "financial_account_id": "2",
    "accounting_code": "4400",
    "campaign_id": "",
    "contribution_campaign_title": "",
    "financial_type_id": "2",
    "contribution_note": "",
    "contribution_batch": "",
    "civicrm_value_donor_information_3_id": "",
    "custom_6": "",
    "custom_5": "",
    "contribution_recur_status": "Completed",
    "payment_instrument": "Check",
    "contribution_status": "Completed",
    "financial_type": "Member Dues",
    "check_number": "",
    "instrument_id": "4",
    "cancel_date": "",
    "id": "101",
    "contribution_type_id": "2",
    "line_items": [
        {
            "id": "103",
            "entity_table": "civicrm_membership",
            "entity_id": "33",
            "contribution_id": "101",
            "price_field_id": "4",
            "qty": "1.00",
            "unit_price": "100.00",
            "line_total": "100.00",
            "price_field_value_id": "7",
            "financial_type_id": "2",
            "non_deductible_amount": "0.00",
            "contribution_type_id": "2"
        }
    ]
}
```


## Sample Order.create for Single Event Registration

Here is how to create an order for a single ticket purchase for an event.

```json
{
  "contact_id": 202,
  "total_amount": 1000.00,
  "financial_type_id": "Event fee",
  "receive_date": "2019-10-08",
  "contribution_status_id": "Pending",
  "line_items" : [
    {
      "params": {
        "event_id": 3,
        "contact_id": 202,
        "role_id": "Attendee",
        "status_id": "Pending from incomplete transaction"
      },
      "line_item": [
        {
          "entity_table":"civicrm_participant",
          "price_field_id":"7",
          "price_field_value_id":"14",
          "qty":"1",
          "unit_price":"1000.00",
          "line_total":"1000.00"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Notes:

1. As with the other examples, we call it with `contribution_status_id` `Pending`.
2. The `params` define the participant.
3. The `line_item` entry defines the price field and its value.
4. On calling `Payment.create` for this order, the participant's status would be changed to Registered.

!!! info
    Before 5.20 there was a bug such that you had to pass in `"status_id": "Pending from incomplete transaction"` otherwise the participant was created as Registered even before the paymnet has been made.


## Sample Order.create for 4 line items

@todo

Here is how to create an order for a membership, an event registration, and two separate contribution line items. [ Rich to provide]


## Transitioning from Contribution.transact api to Order api

Contribution.transact api was a v2 api that we left in place in v3. It has never had unit tests & has never been supported. Unfortunately by not being more aggressive about deprecating it some sites have adopted it.

The Contribution.transact api will create a 'simple' contribution and process a payment. It will not create the line items correctly for anything other than a straight forward donation and does not follow our practice of creating a pending contribution and then adding a payment. It's likely there are other unknown gaps in how it works.

The simplest first step to migrate off it is to replace the order api call with a call that follows the recommended flow but still does not address the line item creation gaps & it is recommended you  look at the patterns above to do that. This first step looks like

```php
// Start with the same parameters as Contribution.transact.
$params = $transactParams;

// It would be better just to include the relevant params but....
$paymentParams = $transactParams;

$params['contribution_status_id'] = 'Pending';
if (!isset($params['invoice_id'])) {
  // Set an invoice_id here if you have not already done so.
  // Potentially Order api should do this https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/financial/issues/78
}
if (!isset($params['invoiceID'])) {
  // This would be required prior to https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/financial/issues/77
  $params['invoiceID'] = $params['invoice_id'];
}
$order = civicrm_api3('Order', 'create', $params);
try {
  // Use the Payment Processor to attempt to take the actual payment. You may
  // pass in other params here, too.
  civicrm_api3('PaymentProcessor', 'pay', [
    'payment_processor_id' => $params['payment_processor_id'],
    'contribution_id' => $order['id'],
    'amount' => $params['total_amount'],
    ]);

  // Assuming the payment was taken, record it which will mark the Contribution
  // as Completed and update related entities.
  civicrm_api3('Payment', 'create', [
    'contribution_id' => $order['id'],
    'total_amount' => $params['amount'],
    'payment_instrument_id' => $params['payment_instrument_id'],
    // If there is a processor, provide it:
    'payment_processor_id' => $params['payment_processor_id'],
    ]);
}
catch (Exception $e) {
  // it failed
}
```

The above is a few more lines  but  it is an important step towards transitioning  to a supported method and away from a flawed api.
